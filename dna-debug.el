;;; dna-debug.el --- functions to assist when debugging your DNA

;;; Commentary:

;; DNA is a form of code delivered with your body. it is not Free
;; Software, because even if you get a working system(you) and many
;; copies of the code, present in all your cells, you dont get the
;; tools to actualy read and understand the code.

;; In order to debug your DNA, you must first aquire a machine
;; readable form of your DNA. You can do this from services such as
;; decodeme, or 23andme.

;; The format used by decodeme looks like this:

;; Name,Variation,Chromosome,Position,Strand,YourCode
;; rs1799971,A/G,6,154402490,+,AG
;; ...

;; rs1799971 is an SNP identifier. Not all snp identifiers currently
;; have any meaningful information associated, but this particular
;; identifier you can examine by doing M-X dnabug-snpedia RET with
;; point at the id. A browser window will open(use w3m to browse in Emacs)
;; and you can then find this entry:

;;  rs1799971(A;G) stronger cravings for alcohol; if alcoholic,
;;  naltrexone treatment 2x more successful

;; This means that if you have this particular snp combination you
;; might consider being careful with alcohol consumption.

;; This is currently the only method of DNA debugging, modifying
;; behaviour such as not to trigger undesired parts of the DNA code, or
;; trigger desired parts. Its not currently feasible to rewrite parts
;; of your DNA (except through spawning, which is outside the scope of
;; this Emacs mode)

;;; Code:
